- 👋 Hi, I’m Asier, nice to meet you :D
- 👀 I’m interested in MLearning and interpretable models. In particular I feel drawn to graphs, clustering, radiomics, multiomics integration and feature selection for applications in precision medicine. Also biophysics :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning bayesian statistics, but I am quite fluid so I wanna have a repository dedicated to each subject I come across as I grow more into the concepts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to continue learning beyond my current PhD, and hopefully land a PostDoc so I am trying to code some R and Python programs that do not deal with the usual ML mumbo-jumbo but with more theoretical applications
- 📫 You can reach me via my email asierrabascomeneghetti@gmail.com :)
